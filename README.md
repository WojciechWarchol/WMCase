# WMCase

Work in progress...

Semi-commercial because I asked a friend who has a small company producing music equipment cases if he wanted an app to make reciving, evaluating and responding to questions about valuating orders of sets of cases. I noticed he has a static page that let's the uset send a message with question. I figured this process can be greatly enchanced.

The projet is in early development. I will be updating it regullary, couple of times a week.

Planed functions:
A browser based interface.
Database of Clients, their Orders, and Cases grouped into orders, traversabl via the web api.
A component for customers to make a valuation request for a specific set of Cases, with parameters defined by the customer (web based api of course)
Automatic evaluation of the price of every Case in the Order, based on the parameters.
The price is then seen by the company owner, who can decide to adjust it and answer to the customer with a suggested date for the order to be processed.
More to come...

Technologies used:
